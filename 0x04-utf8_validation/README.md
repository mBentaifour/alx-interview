This code is designed to validate if a list of integers represents valid UTF-8 encoded data. Each integer in the list represents a byte in the encoding, and the code checks if these bytes adhere to UTF-8 encoding rules. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

### Overview of UTF-8 Encoding

UTF-8 encodes characters in variable-length sequences from 1 to 4 bytes:
- **1-byte sequence**: `0xxxxxxx`
- **2-byte sequence**: `110xxxxx 10xxxxxx`
- **3-byte sequence**: `1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`
- **4-byte sequence**: `11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`

Here:
- The initial bits (e.g., `110`, `1110`) identify the length of the sequence.
- Each byte following the first in a multi-byte sequence starts with `10`.

### Code Explanation

The function `validUTF8` goes through each byte in the input list and checks if it matches these patterns.

#### Step-by-Step Code Explanation

1. **Variable Initialization**
   - `remaining_bytes`: Tracks the number of continuation bytes (starting with `10xxxxxx`) expected in the current multi-byte sequence.
   - `byte_mask_1` and `byte_mask_2`: Bit masks (`10000000` and `01000000`, respectively) used to check specific bit positions.

2. **Loop through Each Byte**
   - The code uses a `for` loop to go through each byte (integer) in `data`.

3. **Check if Continuation Byte is Expected**
   - If `remaining_bytes > 0`, the code expects a continuation byte (`10xxxxxx`):
     - `current_byte & byte_mask_1` checks that the highest bit is `1`.
     - `not (current_byte & byte_mask_2)` checks that the next-highest bit is `0`.
   - If these conditions aren’t met, the sequence is invalid, so the function returns `False`.
   - If the byte matches the pattern, `remaining_bytes` is decreased by 1.

4. **Process First Byte in a Sequence**
   - If `remaining_bytes` is `0`, the byte should be the start of a new sequence. The function checks the following:
     - **1-byte character**: `0xxxxxxx`
       - If `(current_byte & byte_mask_1) == 0`, it's a valid 1-byte character.
     - **Invalid case (starts with `10xxxxxx`)**:
       - If `(current_byte & (byte_mask_1 | byte_mask_2)) == byte_mask_1`, this is invalid, as no sequence should start with `10`.
     - **2-byte character**: `110xxxxx`
       - `(current_byte & (byte_mask_1 | byte_mask_2 | (1 << 5))) == (byte_mask_1 | byte_mask_2)`
       - Sets `remaining_bytes` to `1` to expect one continuation byte.
     - **3-byte character**: `1110xxxx`
       - Sets `remaining_bytes` to `2` for two continuation bytes.
     - **4-byte character**: `11110xxx`
       - Sets `remaining_bytes` to `3` for three continuation bytes.

5. **Final Validation**
   - After the loop, if `remaining_bytes == 0`, all sequences were valid, and the function returns `True`.
   - If `remaining_bytes > 0`, it means the sequence was incomplete, so the function returns `False`.

#### Example

```python
data = [197, 130, 1]  # Represents a valid UTF-8 sequence: 2-byte char and 1-byte char
validUTF8(data)
# Returns: True
```

In this example:
1. `197` in binary (`11000101`) starts a 2-byte character, so `remaining_bytes` is set to `1`.
2. `130` (`10000010`) matches the `10xxxxxx` format as a continuation byte, decrementing `remaining_bytes` to `0`.
3. `1` (`00000001`) is a valid 1-byte character, so the function returns `True`. 

In summary, the code ensures each byte sequence follows UTF-8 encoding rules,
making it a valid or invalid UTF-8 sequenedepending on the outcome.
